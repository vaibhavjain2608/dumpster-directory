    title: 'Flexible Scheduling',

      'Dumpster companies fill their schedules Monday and Friday — demand peaks at the start and end of the work week.

    title: 'Local Companies vs. National Chains',

      'National chains have higher overhead — franchises, call centers, and marketing costs built into their rates.

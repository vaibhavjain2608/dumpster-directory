Many roll-off dumpster providers allow mattresses with a surcharge of $25–$75 per mattress, because mattresses require special handling at the landfill or recycling facility. Some companies include mattresses at no extra charge if you\'re renting for a whole-house or multi-room cleanout. A few companies decline mattresses entirely due to local landfill restrictions.

            Mattress disposal is trickier than most bulky items — banned in many landfills, not
            accepted by most charities unless in perfect condition, and too big to just toss out.

            According to the Sleep Foundation, Americans dispose of approximately <strong>20 million mattresses per year</strong>. Despite that, <strong>80% of a mattress's materials are recyclable</strong> — steel coils, foam, and fabric can all be recovered and reused. The challenge is logistics: mattresses are bulky, many landfills restrict or ban them, and most charities have strict condition requirements. Knowing your options ahead of time saves money and hassle.

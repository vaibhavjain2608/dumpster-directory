States with e-waste bans include California, New York, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, and many others. Penalties vary but can include fines for residents and businesses. Even in states without explicit bans, the EPA strongly discourages landfill disposal of electronics because they contain lead, mercury, cadmium, and lithium — all of which can leach into groundwater.',

On Mac, boot into Recovery Mode and use Disk Utility to erase the drive, then reinstall macOS.

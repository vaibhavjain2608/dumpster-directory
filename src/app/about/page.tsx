            Finding a dumpster rental company used to mean hours of searching, calling numbers that don't
            work, and getting wildly inconsistent quotes. We wanted to fix that.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Our mission is simple: make it easy for anyone — homeowners cleaning out a garage, contractors
            managing a job site, or property managers handling renovations — to find a reliable local dumpster
            rental company in minutes, not hours.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We noticed that searching for "dumpster rental near me" returns a chaotic mix of ads, generic
            directories, and outdated listings. Local service discovery in the dumpster rental space was
            broken — and small, legitimate businesses were hard to find because they couldn't compete with
            large national chains on ad spend.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            We set out to build a clean, focused, trustworthy directory specifically for this industry.
            One place where a homeowner in any city can quickly see their real options, compare companies,
            and reach out — and where local businesses get a fair shot at being discovered.

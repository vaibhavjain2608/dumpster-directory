        text: "For most whole-house cleanouts, a 20 to 30-yard dumpster is the right call. A 20-yard container (approximately 22 ft long × 7.5 ft wide × 4.5 ft tall) handles the contents of a typical 3-bedroom home — furniture, appliances, general household junk, and some construction debris. If you're also dealing with flooring, drywall, or structural materials, step up to a 30-yard. Homes larger than 2,500 sq ft or those requiring heavy demolition often benefit from a 30-yard or two separate hauls with a 20-yard.",

        text: "A 30-yard dumpster (typically 22 ft long × 7.5 ft wide × 6 ft tall) can fit in many residential driveways, but it is tight. You'll need approximately 70 ft of clearance from the street to accommodate the container and the delivery truck's swing room. Vertical clearance requirements of at least 18 ft apply for tree branches, garage door headers, and utility lines — the 6-ft height of a 30-yard container is not the concern, but the delivery truck arm can reach 20+ ft during placement. A 40-yard dumpster at 22 ft long and 8 ft tall generally requires a large driveway or an on-street permit.",

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: "Large dumpster rental costs range from $375 to $750 depending on the container size and your local market. A 20-yard dumpster averages $375–$500 nationally. A 30-yard runs $450–$600, and a 40-yard typically costs $550–$750. Urban markets with higher landfill tipping fees — like New York, San Francisco, or Boston — can push prices 30–50% above those averages. Prices generally include delivery, pickup, and a base weight allowance of 2–4 tons. Overage fees of $60–$100 per ton apply when you exceed the included weight.",

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: "The main difference is capacity and height. A 20-yard dumpster holds approximately 6–8 pickup truck loads of debris and stands about 4.5 ft tall — making it easy to toss debris over the side. It's the standard choice for whole-home remodels, large cleanouts, and mid-size roofing jobs under 3,000 sq ft. A 30-yard dumpster holds 9–12 pickup truck loads and stands 6 ft tall, which is better for new construction, large roofing jobs over 3,000 sq ft, and commercial cleanouts that generate significant volume. The 30-yard typically costs $75–$150 more than a 20-yard but eliminates the need for a second haul on bigger projects.",

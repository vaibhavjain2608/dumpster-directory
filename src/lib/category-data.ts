    intro: `A roll-off dumpster is the large, rectangular open-top container you see parked in driveways and job sites across the US. It gets its name from the way it's delivered — the container rolls off the back of a specialized truck onto your property. Roll-off dumpsters are the go-to choice for any project generating significant waste: home cleanouts, renovations, roofing, construction, and landscaping. Unlike the smaller front-load bins used for regular trash service, roll-offs are rented for a specific project and hauled away when you're done.`,

A tree removal, overgrown shrub removal, sod replacement, or large-scale yard cleanup can quickly fill several pickup truck loads with branches, brush, grass, mulch, and soil. A yard waste dumpster rental eliminates the multiple trips to the green waste facility and lets you work efficiently across days. Most providers accept organic yard debris alongside regular waste in standard containers, though some municipalities require separate disposal. Understanding what's accepted — and what isn't — saves you time and avoids extra charges.`,

      'Renting a dumpster for a roofing project? Compare sizes and pricing for roofing shingle disposal, weight limits, and what roofing contractors need to know.',
    intro: `Asphalt shingles are heavier than they look. A single layer of standard 3-tab shingles weighs about 2–4 lbs per square foot — meaning a 1,500 sq ft roof tear-off generates 3,000–6,000 lbs of debris before you account for underlayment, nails, and flashing. Multiple layers multiply that weight fast. Getting the right dumpster for a roofing job is less about volume than it is about weight — choose too small, or without confirming the weight allowance, and you'll pay significant overage fees. Here's how to get it right.`,
